# DC-Motor-Simulator
This is a simple DC simulator in C++ for Project 1 of Modeling and Analysis of Electrical Machines and Drives. This simulator includes 4 parts: 
## DC Motor initializing
Declared in parameters.h and defined in parameters.cpp. The function is loading parameters of the motor including voltage, inductance, resistance and so on from the file "D:\parameters.txt"
## Solving state equations by Classical Ronge-Kutta method
Declared in RongeKutta.h and defined in RongeKutta.cpp. 
## Hysteresis Controller
Declared in HysteresisController.h and defined in HysteresisController.cpp. The IGBT/P-MOSFET is controlled by both current and speed contorller. 
## PID Controller
Declared in PIDController.h and defined in PIDController.cpp. PID algorithm is introduced to improve the stability of the motor.
